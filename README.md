# DUNGEON CRAWLER

## Description

We have created a program where you choose a Hero. This hero has a series of characteristics such as ID, NAME, STRENGTH, AGILITY, LEVEL and LifePoints. These heroes are in a text file where they are stored. You can choose a hero and are able to modify its characteristics.

Once you choose the hero and modify its characteristics, choose "To Battle" (option 3). Then a simple display will appear. Sit back and watch as your hero faces a series of monstors.

Once this point is finished you will learn of your success .. or failure.

NOTE (Optional): helping the project ASCII Art would be valued.

## Installing

The game can be generically compiled in COBOL. It is known to be compatible with GnuCOBOL.

After compiling the `DUNGCRWL.cbl` program, place the executable into the same directory as your 'HEROES.TXT' and 'DUNGEON.TXT' files. Run the program from there.

The `HEROES.TXT` contains an ASCII list of HERO attributes.

The `DUNGEON.TXT` contains an ASCII list of the monstor attributes in the dungeon.

Examples of these are found in the `bin` subdirectory.

In a Windows environment, the case of the filenames is not important. But in a linux environment, the files must be in all upper-case.

## Note

Winning this game is about setting up the correct attributes of the hero.

While simple, the game is also short and clearly written in COBOL. As such, it is a great tool when learning COBOL programming.
